# Model Deployment with Modelbit

## Overview

This repository provides resources and examples for deploying machine learning models using the Modelbit package in Python. Modelbit simplifies the deployment process by providing easy-to-use tools for deploying models as web services, making them accessible via RESTful APIs.

## Requirements

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Modelbit package (Install via pip: `pip install modelbit`)

## Usage

1. **Installation**: Install the Modelbit package using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install modelbit
   ```

2. **Login**: Use your Google account to login to Modelbit:
   ```python
   import modelbit
   modelbit.login_with_google()
   ```

3. **Model Deployment**: Define your model deployment function and deploy it using Modelbit. Here's an example:
   ```python
   def my_model_predict(input_data):
       # Your model prediction code here
       return prediction_result

   # Deploy the model
   modelbit.deploy(my_model_predict, 'model_name')
   ```

4. **Making Predictions**: Once deployed, you can make predictions by sending requests to the deployed model's endpoint.
